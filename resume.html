System Environment:
Netware 4.10, 4.10 SFTIII, 4.11, 5, SCO Unix, Caldera Linux.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Trans-World Group comprises a group of companies that buy Aluminium and 
Steel (and sundry other metals) from former Soviet Bloc countries and trade 
them on the world market. The group also contains other companies 
involved in shipping, ports, materials handling, engineering and property. 
During my time there I have grown the department to 5 (including self), to 
handle users support (2), development and systems administration. Currently 
we have a user population of 150 spread across 2 countries, with another 
office due for installation in August.

<BR><BR>
I was brought in to take over maintenance and development of existing 
trading and office systems. Trading system a bespoke application written 
in Business Basic running on dumb terminals on SCO Unix. Due to a complete 
lack of any documentation no further work could take place on the system.

<UL>
<LI>Consulted with users to write business and functional specifications for 
new trading system. Decided that due to the small size of the company (at 
that time 25 people in London, 5 in New York. 3 traders) that it would not 
be cost effective to develop new system from scratch so investigated market 
to find suitable package that could be customised. Package chosen was 
RingMaster.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Implemented a network to support Ringmaster and office applications. 
This consisted of a Netware 4.10 server, a PC for each user running a 
standard build of Windows 3.11 with office applications (MS Office, 
cc:Mail, Organizer, Ringmaster) pre-configured. Wrote procedures for 
automating the loading of PC’s.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Wrote a set of table driven conversion utilities to allow data from 
old trading system to be migrated across to RingMaster.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Wrote the specification for a telex and fax system for the shipping 
company. Sourced a suitable hardware and software combination and integrated 
it into our network, feeding all incoming and outgoing telexes through to
 printers, an archive log and into cc:Mail for the users.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Due to the increased size of the company and the increasing reliance 
on IT, I felt it prudent to devise a strategy to try and remove the risks 
associated with the failure of any single piece of critical equipment. 
I migrated the server to Netware 4.10 SFTIII.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>When Trans-World opened an office in Geneva I installed a network in 
there which was managed from London, initially using ISDN for routing.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Installed a network in our New York office, similar to that in London 
and Geneva.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>For commonality we wished to use the same trading software in New York 
as London. It found to be necessary to share some of the data in real-time, 
so I planned and implemented a Frame-Relay based WAN linking London, Geneva, 
New York and Pittsburgh with all of the network infrastructure centrally 
managed from London.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Due to the increased size of the company in London (about 120 active 
users), we introduced two more servers to handle the extra data being 
generate. These used overnight data mirroring to provide an extra level 
of redundancy.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Integrated a Linux server onto the network so that the remaining data 
from the previous trading software could be made available to some 
applications, and hosted on the Netware servers.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Due to the position of the building (on the corner or Old Street and 
City Road), it was felt that there was a risk of disruption to the business 
should a major incident happen. All the telecoms had been handled by C&W. 
I took over control of telecoms and negotiated with Worldcom for the supply 
of a fibre to be brought into the building at a point opposite the C&W one. 
Moving traffic across to Worldcom (and later Frontier as well) also reduced 
our call costs by 50%.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Following on from this I wrote a proposal for disaster recovery 
utilising an off-site server to mirror data overnight. </LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Apart from laptops, we deliberately kept all users running W3.11 in 
order to keep a standardised software configuration. I proposed that we 
switch over to NT to alleviate the deficiencies in 3.11. During the time 
that it took to get the proposal accepted, NT had moved from 3.51 to 4.</LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>The original plan that I wrote for the NT workstation migration 
envisaged upgrading the memory & disk in most of the existing 
machines, however a combination of falling hardware prices and the low 
bundled price of NT4 with a new machine made it cost effective to replace 
the base units of all the machines. The plan called for users to go off in 
groups of 24 for migration training, at which point there machines were 
replaced with boxes preloaded with our standard NT4 build. Throughout the 
network all applications (currently numbering about 100) are distributed 
using Novell’s Zenworks. Before the migration this was a manual process 
dealt with by the helpdesk requiring a large amount of work. The project 
was completed on time and below budget. </LI>

<BR><BR>
<LI>Introduced network scanners for general purpose scanning (non office 
originated documents that have to go to other offices can be routed directly 
to a distant printer) and input to the fax servers, allowing least cost 
routing on outbound faxes.</LI>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As one of the original 3 founders of Quadratron UK, 
I was employed as Technical Manager for approximately 6 and a half years.
 During this time my duties included supporting customers, providing 
support to other Quadratron offices, helping manufacturers with integration 
work, development work, porting etc.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last major project I managed was an 18 month 
development project for the EEC. This involved myself running a team of 
people to modify our software to the requirements of the Commission, and 
then port it on to all of their supported platforms. This became a standard 
software product within the Commission, with about 8000 users, another 
12000 were projected over the 5 year lifespan of the project. Work for the 
commission also involved advising them on security and on hardware and 
software tuning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Porting the software consumed varying amounts of my 
time over the six years. Because of the large size of the source code, 
approximately 600,000 lines, I frequently ran into problems with compiler 
& OS bugs. These had to be tracked down so that I could go back to the 
manufacturer and know that I could can prove to them where the problem lay. 
Because of this work I have gained a good working knowledge of many 
different machines and their operating systems.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of our involvement with the CCTA's MITSY project 
I was working very closely with AT&amp;T's Federal Systems Division from 
very early on in their development cycle for System V/MLS (A B2 secure 
UNIX). The CCTA ultimately decided not to proceed with Systems V/MLS, but 
before that point had been reached all of the necessary design and 
development work had been completed on our product to run in this environment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a company we were frequently asked by manufacturers to 
help them with their bids for major projects, these would involve us working 
very closely with the manufacturers to tune their machines to run our 
software as efficiently as possible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was employed on a fixed term contract to the European 
Space Agency. This involved the design of a new satellite control front end 
systems for the satellite controllers. Up until this time every controller 
had a glass tty and a Tektronix' terminal. This imposed a heavy workload on 
the two main Gould minicomputers so it was decided to replace these with a 
system containing an embedded processor, between 1 and 3 displays (any 
combination of graphics and alphanumeric displays), keyboard and an inkjet 
printer (the first one on the market.) This was built around an 8086 CPU 
card. I was responsible for the majority of the software design and 
implementation on this system which then performed all of the front end 
processing for this mini's. The project was very time critical in that the 
hardware had to be installed and running before the satellite Giotto was 
launched. This in turn was time critical in that it had to intercept 
Halley's comet.
